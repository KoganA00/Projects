Epsilon Carinae </h1><p>Epsilon Carinae, also named Avior,
 is a binary star in the southern constellation of Carina.
 At apparent magnitude +1.86 it is one of the brightest stars
 in the night sky, but is not visible from the northern
 hemisphere. The False Cross is an asterism formed of Delta
 Velorum, Kappa Velorum, Iota Carinae and ? Carinae. It is
 so called because it is sometimes mistaken for the Southern
 Cross, causing errors in astronavigation.
