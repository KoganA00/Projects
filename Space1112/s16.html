R Doradus </h1><p>R Doradus is the name of a red giant
 Mira variable star in the far-southern constellation
 Dorado, although visually it appears more closely
 associated with the constellation Reticulum. Its
 distance from Earth is 178 ± 10 light-years
 (54.6 ± 3.1 parsecs).[1] Having a uniform disk
 diameter of 0.057 ± 0.005 arcsec, it is currently
 believed to be the star with the largest apparent
 size as viewed from Earth (not counting the Sun).
 The estimated diameter of R Doradus is 515 ± 70
 million km (3.46 AU) or 370 ± 50[7] times the
 diameter of the Sun. If placed at the centre of
 the Solar System, the orbit of Mars and most of
 the main asteroid belt would be contained within the star.
