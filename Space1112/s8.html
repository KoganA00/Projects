Vega </h1><p>Vega,
 also designated Alpha Lyrae,
 is the brightest star in the
 constellation of Lyra, the fifth-brightest
 star in the night sky and the second-brightest
 star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after
 Arcturus. It is relatively close at only 25 light-years
 from the Sun, and, together with Arcturus and Sirius,
 one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.
Vega has been extensively studied by astronomers, leading
 it to be termed “arguably the next most important star in
 the sky after the Sun.” Vega was the northern pole star
 around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727
 when the declination will be +86°14'. Vega was the first
 star other than the Sun to be photographed and the first to
 have its spectrum recorded. It was one of the first stars
 whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements.
 Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the photometric
 brightness scale, and was one of the stars used to define the
 mean values for the UBV photometric system.
