Pollux </h1><p>Pollux, also designated Beta Geminorum,
 is an orange-hued evolved giant star approximately
 34 light-years from the Sun in the northern constellation
 of Gemini. It is the closest giant star to the Sun.
Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served
 as one of the stable anchor points by which other
 stars are classified. In 2006, an extrasolar 
 planet was confirmed to be orbiting it.
