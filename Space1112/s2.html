Polaris</h1><p>Polaris, designated Alpha Ursae Minoris,
 commonly the North Star or Pole Star, is the brightest
 star in the constellation of Ursa Minor. It is very close
 to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern
 pole star. The revised Hipparcos parallax gives a distance
 to Polaris of about 433 light-years (133 parsecs)
 while calculations by other methods derive distances around 30% closer.</p>
