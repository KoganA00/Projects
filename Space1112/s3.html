The Sun  </h1> <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.
 It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with
 internal convective motion that generates a magnetic
 field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most
 important source of energy for life on Earth. Its
 diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its
 mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting 
 for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.
 About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%);
 the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities
 of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.</p>
