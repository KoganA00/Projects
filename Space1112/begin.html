<h1>Space</h1><p>
From the perspective of an Earthling, 
outer space is a zone that occurs about 100 
kilometers (60 miles) above the planet, where there is
 no appreciable air to breathe or to scatter light. In that area, 
 blue gives way to black because oxygen molecules are not in enough
  abundance to make the sky blue.

Further, space is a vacuum, meaning that sound cannot carry because 
molecules are not close enough together to transmit sound between them.
 That's not to say that space is empty, however. Gas, dust and other bits
  of matter float around "emptier" areas of the universe, while more 
  crowded regions can host planets, stars and galaxies.
