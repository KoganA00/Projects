The Pistol Star </h1><p>The Pistol Star is a blue
 hypergiant star, one of the most
 luminous known in the Milky Way.
 It is one of many massive young stars
 in the Quintuplet cluster in the Galactic
 Center region. The star owes its name to the
 shape of the Pistol Nebula, which it illuminates.
 It is located approximately 25,000 light years
 from Earth in the direction of Sagittarius. It
 would be visible to the naked eye as a fourth
 magnitude star if it were not for the interstellar
 dust that completely hides it from view in visible light.
