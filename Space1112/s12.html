Gamma Crucis </h1>
<p>Gamma Crucis, also named Gacrux,
 is the nearest red giant star to the Sun.
 The distance to Gacrux has been determined
 using parallax measurements made during
 the Hipparcos mission, which yielded a 
 value of 88.6 light-years (27.2 parsecs)
 away from the Sun. With an apparent
 visual magnitude of +1.63,
 this is the third-brightest star in the southern
 circumpolar constellation of Crux, the Southern 
 Cross, and one of the brightest stars in the night
 sky. A line from the two "Pointers", 
 Alpha Centauri through Beta Centauri, leads to within a few degrees of this star.
