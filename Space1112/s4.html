Deneb </h1><p>Deneb, also designated Alpha Cygni, is the
 brightest star in the constellation of Cygnus.
 It is one of the vertices of the asterism known
 as the Summer Triangle and forms the 'head' of the
 Northern Cross. It is the 19th brightest star in the
 night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.25. A blue-white
 supergiant, Deneb is also one of the most luminous stars.
 However, its exact distance (and hence luminosity) has been
 difficult to calculate; it is estimated to be somewhere between 
 55,000 and 196,000 times as luminous as the Sun.</p>
