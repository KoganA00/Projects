Betelgeuse, also designated Alpha Orionis (? Orionis, abbreviated Alpha Ori, ? Ori), is the ninth-brightest star in the night sky and second-brightest in the constellation of Orion. Distinctly reddish, it is a semiregular variable star whose apparent magnitude varies between 0.0 and 1.3, the widest range of any first-magnitude star. Betelgeuse is one of three stars that make up the Winter Triangle asterism, and it marks the center of the Winter Hexagon. It would be the brightest star in the sky if the human eye could view all wavelengths of radiation.
