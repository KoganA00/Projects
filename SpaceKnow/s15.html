Epsilon Carinae (? Carinae, abbreviated Epsilon Car, ? Car), also named Avior,[11] is a binary star in the southern constellation of Carina. At apparent magnitude +1.86 it is one of the brightest stars in the night sky, but is not visible from the northern hemisphere. The False Cross is an asterism formed of Delta Velorum, Kappa Velorum, Iota Carinae and ? Carinae. It is so called because it is sometimes mistaken for the Southern Cross, causing errors in astronavigation.[12]
