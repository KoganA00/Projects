Arcturus (/??rk?tj??r?s/), also designated Alpha Bootis (? Bootis, abbreviated Alpha Boo, ? Boo) is a star in the constellation of Bootes. It is relatively close at 36.7 light-years from the Sun.[1] Together with Spica and Denebola (or Regulus, depending on the source), Arcturus is part of the Spring Triangle asterism and, by extension, also of the Great Diamond along with the star Cor Caroli.
