Vega, also designated Alpha Lyrae (? Lyrae, abbreviated Alpha Lyr, ? Lyr), is the brightest star in the constellation of Lyra, the fifth-brightest star in the night sky and the second-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus. It is relatively close at only 25 light-years from the Sun, and, together with Arcturus and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.

Vega has been extensively studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed “arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun.”[14] Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727 when the declination will be +86°14'.[15] Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed and the first to have its spectrum recorded.[16][17] It was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements. Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the photometric brightness scale, and was one of the stars used to define the mean values for the UBV photometric system.
