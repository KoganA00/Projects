Sirius is a star system and the brightest star in the Earth's night sky. 
With a visual apparent magnitude of −1.46, it is almost twice as bright as Canopus,
 the next brightest star. The name "Sirius" is derived from the Ancient Greek Σείριος
  (Seirios), meaning "glowing" or "scorcher". The system has the Bayer designation 
  Alpha Canis Majoris (α CMa). What the naked eye perceives as a single star is actually
   a binary star system, consisting of a white
 main-sequence star of spectral type A1V, termed Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion
  of spectral type DA2, called Sirius B. The distance separating Sirius A from its companion
   varies between 8.2 and 31.5 AU.
