Gamma Crucis (? Crucis, abbreviated Gamma Cru, ? Cru), also named Gacrux,[10] is the nearest red giant star to the Sun.[7] The distance to Gacrux has been determined using parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, which yielded a value of 88.6 light-years (27.2 parsecs) away from the Sun.[1] With an apparent visual magnitude of +1.63,[11] this is the third-brightest star in the southern circumpolar constellation of Crux, the Southern Cross, and one of the brightest stars in the night sky. A line from the two "Pointers", Alpha Centauri through Beta Centauri, leads to within a few degrees of this star.
